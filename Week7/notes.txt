Testing

How do we know the code we are writing is correct?
Use library unittest
Write docstrings for testing!!!



Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery

Good code writing practices, especially for big projects



CI: Anytime someone merges to the main branch, a series of tests is run (automated unit testing) -> fix it before merging

Github Actions - when someone pushes to a repository, make sure it goes through some steps
- use yaml files to run tests on pushing to a github repository




CD: how it gets deployed. shorter release schedules. incrementally make changes (probably will have less bugs to fix before delivering)
also advantageous on competitive market, needs to be fast

Use Docker files to run a docker container (more lightweight than virtual machine but still consistent)
